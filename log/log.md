# Progress Log

## Monday, 17 April

**Today's Progress**
* Watched CS50 Week 10 Lecture
* Started YDKJS ES6 Ch7 (up to [Proxies](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/es6%20%26%20beyond/ch7.md#proxies))

**Thoughts**:
The CS50 lecture was mostly (but not entirely) review. That said, the form validation information was both interesting and helpful.

## Sunday, 16 April

**Today's Progress**
* Finished CS50 pset7 (implemented history and additional feature)
* Forked repo for FCC speedrun challenge (starts Tuesday)

**Thoughts**:
Today was Easter Sunday. Other things took precedence.

## Saturday, 15 April

**Today's Progress**
* Finished YDKJS ES6 Chapter 6
* Worked on CS50 pset 7 (implemented index, sell, history)
* Worked on Momentum clone with L (got settings working)

**Thoughts**:
Productive day.

## Friday, 14 April

**Today's Progress**
* Joined Rhinos Cohort (and added intro)
* Finished YDKJS ES6 Ch. 5, started Ch. 6 (did Arrays section)
* Finished write-up of mini-project (adding user stylesheets for github)

**Thoughts**: Chugging along. The end of the YDKJS books is in sight - which is a good thing. They've been a fantastic resource, but after working on them for almost 3 months, I'm ready to change things up a bit. I'm hoping that by the end of this next week, I'll be done with the YDKJS books & done with the Momentum clone. I'll still have CS50 to work on... and so many *new* things on the horizon!

## Thursday, 13 April

**Today's Progress**
* Finished working through YDKJS ES6 Chapter 4
* Read YDKJS Async & Performance Appendix B
* Started working through YDKJS ES6 Chapter 5 (up to sets)
* Revised write-up of "fix" to github's css (from last Friday)

**Thoughts**:
I didn't really understand a whole lot of Appendix B... but that's okay. I have a very, very rudimentary understanding of the concepts presented in that chapter, and I know where to go when I'm a little bit further along. After reviewing promises in YDKJS ES6 Chapter 4, I'm feeling a little bit more comfortable with that, and I'm marking the "Async" book complete.

**Link(s) to work**:
More code to practice concepts from YDKJS: [promises](https://github.com/AgathaLynn/web-development-learning-path/blob/master/You-Dont-Know-JS/practice/es6-ch4-promises2.js) and [maps](https://github.com/AgathaLynn/web-development-learning-path/blob/master/You-Dont-Know-JS/practice/es6-ch5-maps.js)

## Wednesday, 12 April

**Today's Progress**
* Finished working through YDKJS ES6 Chapter 3
* Started YDKJS ES6 Chapter 4
* Met with team for momentum clone project

**Thoughts**:
A lot of the content of the YDKJS ES6 book is review -- which I badly needed. I'm starting to feel like things are dragging and I'm not making much progress. It might help to devote a day to just *finishing* some of the stuff I started, so that I can move forward.

## Tuesday, 11 April

**Today's Progress**
* Read through YDKJS ES6 Chapter 3 Modules section

**Thoughts**:
I'm unsure of how or where to actually play around with Javascript modules - they don't have browser support (yet), and I can't use them in Node.

**Link(s) to work**:
None today

## Monday, 10 April

**Today's Progress**
* Pair programming with L (momentum clone)

**Thoughts**:
Getting close to finished with this one.

## Sunday, 9 April

**Today's Progress**
* Pair programming with L (momentum clone)
* Worked through YDKJS ES6 Chapter 3 Iterators section

**Thoughts**: I had fun today. Fixed a bug (it turns out that getting data from local storage is async - which I *should* have realized, had I actually thought about it...). I've still got a ways to go before I'll have real solid knowledge of the YDKJS material, but I'm definitely getting better.

## Friday, 7 April

**Today's Progress**
* Wrote JavaScript to "fix" GitHub's responsive layout so that I can read README files on a split screen
* Finished working through YDKJS ES6 Chapter 2

**Thoughts**: I kind of got side-tracked today... but I made something that I'm actually using, which is kind of neat.

## Thursday, 6 April

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on YDKJS ES6 Chapter 2 (Destructuring, Object Literal Extensions)

**Thoughts**:
Slow going - I actually worked for quite a long time today... but I'm still feeling like it's not *enough*. Ah, well. Destructuring is kind of neat. I also like the "super" feature. I've been running into cases where I *wished* I could go up the prototype chain and call a "parent" function in the "child" function that overwrites it... and now I can. At least in certain circumstances if conditions are favorable.

## Wednesday, 5 April

**Today's Progress**
* Began working on CS50 pset7 (implemented register, quote, buy)
* Worked on momentum project (fixed positioning of quote div)
* Read YDKJS ES6 chapters: Forward, Chapter 1
* Started YDKJS ES6 chapter 2: up to ["Destructuring"](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/es6%20%26%20beyond/ch2.md#destructuring)


**Thoughts**:
I'm feeling a little bit in over my head today. Actually - alternating between feeling like I'm learning a lot and feeling like I'll never learn enough. Ah, well. I guess I just keep chugging along

**Link(s) to work**:
Simple code examples to help me understand concepts from reading: [let and block scoping](https://github.com/AgathaLynn/web-development-learning-path/blob/master/You-Dont-Know-JS/practice/es6-ch2-let.js) & [spread operator](https://github.com/AgathaLynn/web-development-learning-path/blob/master/You-Dont-Know-JS/practice/es6-ch2-spread.js)

## Tuesday, 4 April

**Today's Progress**
* Read through YDKJS Async and Performance Appendix A, played with Asynquence library
* Watched CS50 Live S3E1 (SHAttered) - about how SHA-1 has been broken
* Met with T and L to discuss momentum progress

**Thoughts**:
I'm really shaky on the whole promises thing. My thought right now - because I'm starting to get annoyed at my lack of progress - is to go ahead and keep moving forward. I'm skipping Appendix B (there's no point in doing that until I understand promises better), and moving on. At some point soon I'll do a project that actually uses promises (not today, I can't start something new right now)... and I'll revist things then.

Still got a fair bit out of Appendix A, though. If nothing else, I learned how to install and use a module on my computer using npm.

None: sick

**Thoughts**:
I'll be better on Wednesday? I hope?

**Link(s) to work**:
Nope.


## Saturday, 1 April

**Today's Progress**
* Finished YDKJS Async and Performance Chapter 4
* Read YDKJS Async and Performance Chapters 5 & 6

**Thoughts**:
This YDKJS book was trickier... and I still don't feel like I have a fantastic understanding of promises (either their use or their use *case*). I'm going to go ahead and move on for now... but I also thing that at some point I'll probably want to come back to chapter 3, at some point.

## Friday, 31 March

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on momentum project - looked into how to implement loading page

**Thoughts**:
I actually spent a fair bit of time working today, but I didn't really *accomplish* anything. I'm running into snags (that's good - means I'm learning) that I'm not sure how to resolve. I'd like to implement a loading page... but I'm having trouble figuring out how to signal to my code that everything is done "loading", so that the loading symbol can go away and the page can be revealed.

**Link(s) to work**:
Nothing new to speak of

## Thursday, 30 March

**Today's Progress**
* Worked through next section of YDKJS Async and Performance Chapter 4 (up to [Promise Concurrency in Generators](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/async%20%26%20performance/ch4.md#promise-concurrency-in-generators))

**Thoughts**:
Even when you don't think that you need to play with the example code in the reading... it's still not a bad idea. I *thought* I understood how one code snippet in the reading was working, and ended up spending over half an hour getting my "easy" sample to run. Yeah. I *think* I understand it now. But I'm glad I took the time to mess around with the code, before I tried to make it work on an actual project!

## Tuesday, 28 March

**Today's Progress**
* Began working on YDKJS Async & Performance Chapter 4 (up to [iterating generators asynchronously](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/async%20%26%20performance/ch4.md#iterating-generators-asynchronously))
* Mtg with momentum group

**Thoughts**:
Case sensitivity matters: I accidentally messed up one of my git "pushes" (fortunately just this log!) to github, because I accidentally typed a letter lowercase that was supposed to be uppercase. It looked right on my computer... but it wasn't right in github. I wonder if there's some sort of tool that would catch those errors and ask me if I'm *SURE*... I can't be the first person to accidentally type a lowercase letter instead of an uppercase one, and I could have ended up with a much bigger mess than I did.

Also... I actually used Node! I installed it a while back, and never did anything with it. And then today I used it to run programs. I made some simple programs (for getting the fibonacci sequence) to help me understand the reading for YDKJS... and I was able to run them from actual files on my own computer, without having to mess with the browser console. Neat!

## Sunday, 26 March

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on CSS for momentum project
* Pair programming on momentum project (with L)

**Thoughts**:
I like Javascript better than HTML and CSS. Which makes sense, I guess: Javascript is *programming*, and HTML and CSS kind of aren't. Also, technology is kind of frustrating at times.

## Saturday, 25 March

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on refactoring todos (momentum project) & created pull request
* Started working on CSS


**Thoughts**:
I kind of like refactoring.

## Friday, 24 March

**Today's Progress**
* Finished CS50 pset6
* Watched CS50 Week 9 lecture
* Pair programming (momentum project with T)
* Worked on refactoring todos (momentum project)

**Thoughts**:
I think I *might* be beginning to understand/appreciate the motivation behind MongoDB and other no-sql databases... *maybe*. Not because there's anything wrong with SQL, but more because the lecture talked about ways to kind of "hide" SQL so that you could interact with it like with an object, and it seems like Mongo might *kind of* be taking the "hiding" one step further. Or I might be completely wrong. It's just a sort of question/impression.

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on CS50 pset6

## Wednesday, 22 March

**Today's Progress**
* Watched CS50 Week 8 lecture
* Started CS50 pset6 (implemented mario.py, credit.py, vigenere.py)

**Thoughts**: Chugging along. Slowly, but still chugging.

None today

## Tuesday, 21 March

**Today's Progress**
* Watched CS50 Week 7 lecture
* Deployed yesterday's Writer's Block project using surge.sh
* Met with momentum group

**Thoughts**: Deploying the website was a lot easier than I thought it would be. And promises are a lot *harder* than I thought they would be. I'm actually not sure that it's promises that are the problem. It might be that I don't have a good use case for them. I had a couple of different ideas about how to use them... but they would require writing code to turn an xmlhhtprequest into a promise and/or writing code to turn an event listener into a promise. Which makes me wonder if maybe I'm not understanding when/how they're actually supposed to be used.

**Link(s) to work**:
Writer's Block website: http://writers-block.surge.sh

## Monday, 20 March

**Today's Progress**
* Finished CS50 pset 5 (using linked list)
* Watched CS50 Week 6 shorts: Internet Primer, IP, TCP, HTTP
* Created simple "writer's block" website to practice ajax requests (sans jQuery)
* Worked on momentum project todo list (pairing with T)

**Thoughts**: I'm not entirely happy with my solution to pset5 - a linked list is *NOT* the best data structure for the project - but I kind of needed to have that done, because I've been stuck on it for way too long. The spell checker is done, it works, and there are no memory leaks. It's just slow. And so we're moving on.

Today was a good day, programming-wise. Pairing on the momentum project went well - the todo list is functional, so that's cool. And I also made a simple (very, very simple) website to practice making API requests without using JQuery. I wanted to try using promises... but I realized I needed to take a step backward and do this first. So today was a lot of baby steps... but at least they were baby steps in the right direction!

To-dos: Tomorrow (or soon) I'd like to see about getting my practice project up online (maybe try out surge.sh?). And then keep chugging away on the other works-in-progress: CS50, momentum project, YDKJS.

## Sunday, 19 March

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on momentum project (pairing with L)
* Finished watching CS50 Week 6 lecture
* Worked on CS50 pset5

**Thoughts**: I implemented the load and unload functions for pset5... but I did so using a singly linked list, which is *NOT* going to do well speed-wise. I was having enough trouble with the problem set, though. Doing it this way made sense for now - I was at least able to get things working, basically. (Well... partially working, anyway.) And I can always go back and re-implement the thing using a different data structure. I probably *should* to back... but we'll see how things go.

I worked with L on the momentum project today, and chrome really wasn't liking our trying to make an api call to that one quote-generator. I think the problem has to do with some sort of security requirement implemented by chrome extensions (it worked fine in L's quote machine, and if I ran the "extension" from a file folder on my computer). But it frustrates me that I haven't been able to figure out what exactly the issue was, or how to resolve it. Maybe L will have better luck.

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on CS50 pset 5
* Watched first 56 minutes of CS50 Week 6 lecture

I'm a bit confused about how to separate the parts of a website so that different people can work on them independently. I suspect this project will be a case study in how NOT to do things... but it will be a great learning experience.

**Thoughts**:
That Bender puzzle is a doozy... and the chingu group project is teaching me a lot... even though I haven't started actually coding yet and find the whole thing pretty overwhelming.

## Monday, 27 February

**Today's Progress**
* Installed Nodejs on computer and updated npm
* Did sections 1-15 of the "Getting Started" section of the npm Documentation
* Worked on bookstore website
* Met with BUILD-to-LEARN team in Chingu cohort

**Thoughts**: Installing npm was tricky, actually, but I think I have it working for now. As long as I don't have to do any updates or anything. So now I have another tool that I can play with.

**Link(s) to work**:
Not quite yet...

## Sunday, 26 February

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on bookstore website
* Solved "The Gift" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**: The bookstore website is coming along - today I got the "News" page done. We're kind of to the point where what's left is a bunch of annoying little tasks. That, and I'm kind of realizing there are a few things that maybe won't work exactly the way I wanted them to. Which is really just part of the learning process, and the reason I'm doing so many of these projects to begin with, right?

**Link(s) to work**:
Still nothing. Soon...

## Saturday, 25 February

**Today's Progress**
* Reread chapters 1-2 of YDKJS: Async & Performance

**Thoughts**: Wasn't able to code today... but the good news is that the YDKJS chapters made a lot more sense the second time I read through them.

**Link(s) to work**:
No work => no links.

## Friday, 24 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Solved "Skynet Revolution: Episode 1" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Solved "Conway Sequence" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Began CS50 pset5

**Thoughts**: This CS50 problem set is going to take a while, I think... I probably need to plan on spending a few good long blocks of time on it. Otherwise, didn't do a whole lot today. I had intended to do a pair programming session this evening, but that didn't pan out. Hopefully another time...


**Link(s) to work**:
Still none.


## Thursday, 23 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on bookstore website
* Solved "Don't Panic - Episode 1" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Solved "Telephone Numbers" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Watched CS50 Week 5 Shorts: Hash Tables, Tries

**Thoughts**: Tries are kind of weird, and kind of neat. Both of these CodinGame puzzles were ones that seemed tricky on the outset, but the difficulty was really just in getting a good understanding of the problem - the code was actually pretty simple for both. Relatively speaking.
The bookstore website is coming along, and I'm getting more comfortable with git as well (today I created, merged, and deleted branches).

**Link(s) to work**:
Still none - hopefully that will be changing this next week.

## Wednesday, 22 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on bookstore website

**Thoughts**: CSS is a time suck. You'd never have guessed that I spent as much time as I did working on the thing. Also... I still think that iframes are kind of cool.

**Link(s) to work**:
Not online... still.

## Tuesday, 21 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Finished Shay Howe's "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series
* Began working on personal project (fake website for local bookstore)

**Thoughts**:
The "fake website" project is fun, and a great way to practice the HTML and CSS stuff that I just finished reading. It's a fake website, but I (being the incredibly uncreative person that I am) have *real* names and contact info in it... so it's not going onto github. Oh, well.

**Link(s) to work**:
Not online, unfortunately. I was actually kind of looking forward to having something to link to...


## Monday, 20 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Watched CS50 Week 5 Shorts: Stacks, Queues
* Solved "Shadows of the Knight" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Completed lessons 10-11 of Shay Howe's "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series

**Thoughts**:
I think this is the 3rd (or 4th?) time that I've tried to do a binary search algorithm... and it's getting to the point where it's coming pretty naturally. That's a good thing.

**Today's Progress**
* Completed lesson 9 of Shay Howe's "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series
* Watched CS50 Week 5 Shorts: Singly-Linked Lists, Doubly-Linked Lists

**Thoughts**:
Today's "Aha" moment (silly though it may be) was learning what iframes *are* and having at least a rudimentary understanding of how they work. Who knew that embedding a map into a website was so easy?!

I also have an idea for an "okay, now you try it" to do once I've finished reading through Howe's articles - a mock website for a local bookstore. Should be fun...

## Friday, 17 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Solved "Mayan Calculation" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Completed lessons 4-6 of Shay Howe's "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series

**Thoughts**:
The "Mayan Calculation" puzzles was already mostly solved on Wednesday. What I did today was basically just bug fixes and cleaning up the code a bit. The "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series is really helpful, and I'm pretty sure it's one I'll be referring back to. I can't wait to finish the tutorial and try a few simple projects, just so I can cement some of this stuff in my brain.

Also, the Chingu Cohorts start today, so that's exciting.

**Link(s) to work**:
None today... except for the sample project copied from "Learn to Code HTML & CSS." Which isn't mine.


## Thursday, 16 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Finished watching CS50 Week 5 Lecture
* Completed lessons 1-3 of Shay Howe's "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series
* Reviewed and submitted homework for CS50 Week 2

**Thoughts**:
The information in the HTML & CSS articles is largely review, but it's *good* review. It's helpful to see examples of how a multi-page website is structured - different directories for "assets" (stylesheets, images), different files for different pages, etc. And how parts of the html and css are re-used across different pages on the same website.

Folder for "Learn to Code..." created in this directory. Not a link, though.


## Wednesday, 15 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Watched first 57 minutes of CS50 Week 5 Lecture
* Began working on "Mayan Calculation" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**:
I am *so* tired today...

**Link(s) to work**:
None.

## Tuesday, 14 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Mostly solved "Recover" from the CS50 Week 4 homework assignments

**Thoughts**
* Little bugs can take forever to figure out. Going away and coming back later can help.

**Link(s) to work**:
None today.

## Monday, 13 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Watched CS50 Week 4 Shorts: Structures
* Solved "Resize" (Less Comfortable Version) from the CS50 Week 4 homework assignments

**Thoughts**:
I've been trying to do the more difficult versions of the CS50 homework problems... but even the easier version of this one took me well over two hours. Maybe I'll go back and do the other one later... or maybe not. We'll see.

## Sunday, 12 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Reviewed and submitted homework for CS50 Week 1
* Watched CS50 Week 4 Shorts: Pointers, Dynamic Memory Allocation
* Solved "Stock Exchange Losses" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**: Didn't do a whole lot today. Pointers and dynamic memory allocation don't seem *hard*, per se, just a lot of syntax and steps to keep track of.

**Link(s) to work**:
None today.

## Saturday, 11 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Solved "Whodunit" from the CS50 Week 4 homework assignments
* Watched CS50 Week 4 Shorts: Hexadecimal, Call Stack

**Thoughts**:
I also actually submitted pset0 for the CS50 course (they have the 2017 submission system set up now) - that isn't really a *coding* problem, though. More of an anxiety problem, I guess. I think I made the "Whodunit" problem a lot harder than it needed to be, but it was really interesting to actually get a peek at the details of *how* a computer actually stores images (specifically) and different types of files (more generally).

## Friday, 10 February 2017

**Today's Progress**:
* Finished watching lecture from CS50 Week 4
* Worked thorugh You-Dont-Know-JS Book 5, Chapter 2
* Solved "War" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**:
I feel like a have, at best, a tenuous grasp of promises (the topic of the YDKJS reading). It might not be a bad idea to take a day or two and try to put together a (simple) project that uses them - possibly going back and doing a bare-bones (it doesn't have to be pretty) implementation of one of the FCC front-end projects (or some other project) that gets data from an API, just to see if I can make the material "click" a little bit better.

## Thursday, 9 February 2017

**Today's Progress**:
* Worked through You-Dont-Know-JS Book 5, Chapter 1
* Solved "Scrabble" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Began watching lecture from CS50 Week 4 (first 55 minutes)

**Thoughts**:
The CodinGame puzzle took a lot longer than it should have, but I got a bit of practice working with objects, and spent a *long* time trying to find a bug in my solution: turns out that if you pass a string into match (e.g. `str.match('a')`), it converts the string `a` to a regular expression and only looks for the *first* match. If you want to find *all* the 'a's, you need to use the RegExp constructor with the 'g' flag. Silly syntax problem... but I guess I'll remember that one better going forward.   

The part of the CS50 lecture that I watched had mainly to do with pointers... and explained some of (maybe all?) the asterisks I was getting so confused about during the last couple of homework assignments.

## Wednesday, 8 February 2017

**Today's Progress**:
* Worked through You-Dont-Know-JS Book 5, Chapter 1.
* Completed "Game of Fifteen" homework assignment from CS50 Week 3
* Solved "The Last Crusade" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**:
The CS50 assignment was fairly straightforward to implement - Manipulating *strings* in C still feels strange to me, but this assignment didn't involve too much of that. The YDKJS reading explains chunking and concurrency in a way that I *think* I can finally understand, and that kind of makes me want to go back and take another look at some of the FCC frontend projects that use APIs to get data.  

**Link(s) to work**:
The idea for (and format of) this log is taken from the [100 Days Of Code](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) challenge. Other than that, nothing today.
