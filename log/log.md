# Progress Log

## Friday, 26 May

**Today's Progress**
* Started clone of material resume
* Continued *JavaScript Allongé* (through "OOP")

**Thoughts**:
JavaScript is fun. CSS is largely a time-suck. Which isn't to say that it *isn't* fun (sometimes it is)... but it's not like actual programming. I'm *trying* to get better at grouping and reusing styles, but I'm not sure how well I'm succeeding - I haven't done the actual resume content yet (just the colored bands at the top and bottom), and I'm already at 200 lines of code. I was hoping to finish today, but it looks like by Monday might be a safer bet.

**Link(s) to work**:
Resume clone so far: [here](../clones/material-resume/index.html). And practice code from JS Allongé: [here](../js-allonge/getwith.js) and [here](../js-allonge/deep-mapping.js).

## Thursday, 25 May

**Today's Progress**
* Read "Learn to Code" lesson 10 (Semantics & Accessibility)
* Solved "Bender - Episode 1" from *Codingame Classic Puzzles - Medium*
* Continued *Javascript Allonge* (up to "getWith")

**Thoughts**: I had tried (unsuccessfully) to complete the Bender puzzle in early March. Today it was... not *easy*, exactly... but fairly straightforward. Which probably means I'm learning! I know that I'm improving in some respects - learning to use Node and Express and MongoDb... but I haven't noticed a major improvement in my skills with "just" JavaScript. So it was kind of cool to see that the improvement is actually happening.

**Link(s) to work**:
Solution to the [Bender Puzzle](../codingame/bender.js).
Practice code from *Javascript Allonge*: [method decorators](../js-allonge/method-decorators.js), [memoized fibonacci](../js-allonge/memoize.js)


## Wednesday, 24 May

**Today's Progress**
* Did "Learn to Code" lesson 9 (Feature Support & Polyfills)
* Continued *Javascript Allongé* (up to "This and That")

**Thoughts**: Didn't spend a lot of time on coding today.

**Link(s) to work**:
Practice code from reading: [here](../js-allonge/stack.js)

## Tuesday, 23 May

**Today's Progress**
* Did "Learn to Code" lesson 8 (Transitions & Animations)
* Continued *Javascript Allonge* (up to "A Warm Cup")

**Thoughts**: The transitions and animations lesson made everything sound so easy. And I know it won't be - a lot of the difficulty, I think, will be in figuring out how exactly things *ought* to move. That is, figuring out what code to write.

**Link(s) to work**:
Practice code with CSS transitions: [here](../learn-to-code/transitions)

Practice code from *JavaScript Allonge*: [flipping](../js-allonge/data-flip.js), [mapping](../js-allonge/data-map), and puzzling out [how the Y combinator works](../js-allonge/why.js)

## Monday, 22 May

**Today's Progress**
* Continued *Javascript Allonge* (Up to "Recipes with Data")

**Thoughts**:
I like JavaScript. (Also... the idea of making linked lists out of functions is weird, but kind of cool.)

**Link(s) to work**: Practice code from *Javascript Allonge*: [more folding](../js-allonge/morefolds.js), [iterators](../js-allonge/iterators.js), [data](../js-allonge/data.js)

## Sunday, 21 May

**Today's Progress**
* Continued *Javascript Allonge* (Up to "Tortoises, Hares, ...")

**Thoughts**:
Much fun

**Link(s) to work**:
Practice code from *Javascript Allonge*: [tailcalls](../js-allonge/tailcalls.js)

## Saturday, 20 May

**Today's Progress**
* Continued *Javascript Allonge* (up to "Tail Calls")
* Did "Learn to Code Advanced HTML & CSS" lesson 7

**Thoughts**: I miss projects...
Seriously - CSS isn't my favorite thing in the whole world, but I did have fun playing around with transforms. And *JavaScript Allonge* is interesting - if a bit weird. I'm glad I watched the lecture first. It helps to see the motivation for why we're doing things the way that we are (because otherwise I'd be wondering).

**Link(s) to work**:
Playing with CSS transforms on Codepen: [here](https://codepen.io/AgathaLynn/pen/WjYOeL?editors=1100)

## Friday, 19 May

**Today's Progress**
* Worked through "Learn to Code Advanced HTML & CSS" lesson 5 & 6
* Watched lecture "intro" to *Javascript Allonge*
* Started *Javascript Allonge* (up to "Recipes with Basic Functions")

**Thoughts**:
Arrow functions are a lot harder to read than "normal" functions - at least when they aren't one-liners.

**Link(s) to work**:
I didn't save most of my practice code from the reading, but what I have is [here](../js-allonge/basic-functions.js)

## Thursday, 18 May

**Today's Progress**
* Finished bot project
* Worked through "Learn to Code Advanced HTML & CSS" lesson 4
* Did sections 3-4 of *Setting up ES6*

**Thoughts**:
With regard to the bot project - there are *always* more things that can be done, so it's kind of hard to call the project "finished". I might still come back and make tweaks. But I want to shift my focus for the next couple of weeks back over to my "learning path" - and then start another project (either a personal project or one of the freeCodeCamp projects).

Bot project: [repo](https://github.com/AgathaLynn/slack-fccbot) and [landing page](http://slack-fccbot.herokuapp.com)


## Wednesday, 17 May

**Today's Progress**
* Worked through "Learn to code Advanced HTML & CSS" lesson 3
* Worked on bot project (just about done!)

**Thoughts**:

**Link(s) to work**:
Practice code from reading: [CSS Selectors](../learn-to-code/complex-selectors/)
Bot project repo: [here](https://github.com/AgathaLynn/slack-fccbot)

## Monday & Tuesday, 15-16 May

**Today's Progress**
* Continued work on bot project

**Thoughts**:
I think I might end up dropping phase 2 of the speedrun challenge. I've been focusing on getting this bot project finished (nicely - because it's a good learning experience, and because it's a project that will be shared). I feel like trying to do both is stretching me too thin, and this one feels more important right now.

And I've been neglecting the p1xt study guide items, which isn't the end of the world (I'm still learning). But it would be nice to be moving forward again.

## Saturday & Sunday, 13-14 May

**Today's Progress**
* Continued work on bot project & Landing page

## Friday, 12 May

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on bot project

**Thoughts**:
The bot project is coming along well, and I'm getting so much more comfortable working with a database (yay Mongoose? It definitely makes at least some things easier, right from the get-go). Still kind of confused about the Speedrun API stuff...

**Link(s) to work**:
Bot project repo: [here](https://github.com/AgathaLynn/rhino-bot-project)

## Thursday, 11 May

**Today's Progress**
* Finished *Effective Thinking through Mathematics* course
* Read "Learn to Code Advanced HTML & CSS" Lesson 2

**Thoughts**:
I'm trying to figure out how to put my speedrun projects together into a single-page app, and... I'm kind of confused. I think I can figure out most of the stuff... but how to do the API projects? How can I deliver *just* JSON to a user... on the same page that I've already delivered.

## Wednesday, 10 May

**Today's Progress**
* Finished Week 4 of *Effective Thinking through Mathematics*

## Tuesday, 9 May

**Today's Progress**
* Read up on and installed Gulp
* Worked on bot project

## Monday, 8 May

**Today's Progress**
* Completed File Metadata API project & write-up
* Did Week 3 of *Effective Thinking through Mathematics*

**Thoughts**:
The file metadata project was easier than I expected - the project and write-up only took a couple of hours. The information in the Effective Thinking course has all been familiar so far (which is to be expected)... but the instructor does an absolutely fantastic job of making some really challenging concepts seem almost intuitive.

I also did a little bit of reading today about implementing a build process. I think it's time. If I'm writing ES6 client-side code, then I really need to think about transpiling. And if I want to use Vue - and I probably ought to try out Vue or React or something - then I'll want to convert those files into "normal" files. Plus I need to figure out how to minify css and compress images and stuff sooner or later. Might as well be sooner. And there's unit testing to think about, and it would be awesome if I could use modules in client-side code... So yeah. It's time. I just need to figure out where to start.

Gulp, maybe?

## Sunday, 7 May

**Today's Progress**
* Did write-up for image search abstraction layer api project (fcc speedrun)

**Thoughts**:
Not much to say outside of the log. Except that I think I really need to go back and learn MongoDB the *right* way, instead of just picking out the bits and pieces I want to use.

## Saturday, 6 May

**Today's Progress**
* Got api image search project working

**Thoughts**:
The image search project actually came together much more easily than I expected. I did open up previous projects to use as a reference when writing code for this one. Also - I think I'm setting up my databases wrong? Maybe? I guess I'll figure it out when I get to the relevant sections in the guide (if not before).

## Friday, 5 May

**Today's Progress**
* Watched Section 3 of VueJS course on Udemy
* Did Twitch.tv project and write-up

**Thoughts**:

**Link(s) to work**:


## Thursday, 4 May

**Today's Progress**
* Read "Project Specification Documents" article
* Used article to help me sketch out a plan/idea for bot project
* Got started on bot project

**Thoughts**:
I'm not sure how big of a group we're going to end up having for this group project... it would be nice if A would check back in and there were at least two of us. Otherwise, things are going along pretty well, and it's fun anyway.

## Wednesday, 3 May

**Today's Progress**
* Wrote and published write-up of tic-tac-toe game
* Did Week 2 of "Effective Thinking Through Mathematics"

**Thoughts**:

**Link(s) to work**:

## Tuesday, 2 May

**Today's Progress**
* Made Tic-Tac-Toe game (will review tomorrow)
* Watched sections 1 and 2 of Vue JS course on Udemy

**Thoughts**:
I was going to use Vue JS for the Tic-Tac-Toe game... but then I decided to go ahead and start, and then I was finished, and I never did get to the "adding Vue" part. Oh, well.

## Monday, 1 May

**Today's Progress**
* Finished URL shortener API project
* Drafted blog article on URL shortener project

**Thoughts**:
MongoDB was as challenging as I expected. But I'm learning

**Link(s) to work**:
Project repo: [here](https://github.com/AgathaLynn/chingu-fcc-speedrun-challenge/tree/master/backend/api-url-shortener)

## Sunday, 30 April

**Today's Progress**
* Effective Thinking through Mathematics: Introduction & Week 1
* Installed MongoDB, worked through Quick Start guide
* Started FCC URL-Shortener API project

**Thoughts**:
Most of today's work had to do with getting MongoDB set up and figuring out how to use it. It's new and different and messy. But I'll get used to it, and then it will be just another tool. And maybe one I'll really enjoy.

The "Effective Thinking" course is actually skipping ahead a little bit, which I did on purpose to give myself a bit of a break. The course is easy (as I figured it might be). I'm kind of feeling like I might have stretched myself too thin...

## Saturday, 29 April

**Today's Progress**
* Finished CS50 pset 8
* Worked on bot project - got two commands (exorcise, emojify) working
* Read "Learn to Code Advanced HTML & CSS", part 1

**Thoughts**:
I'm just about done with CS50. I think that over the next week or so, I'm going to watch through some (not all) of the Week 11 seminars. After that, all that's left is the final project. Which I'm going to skip for right now. Between the Speedrun Challenge and the Bot project, my hands are full. (Honestly - I might just skip the project entirely. I'm doing enough other projects that *could* fulfill the requirements, I'm just not doing them specifically for this course.)

## Saturday, 22 April

**Today's Progress**
* Completed Request Header Parser API project (#4 of FCC Speedrun Challenge)
* Wrote and published blog post on Request Header Parser project
* Watched last CS50 Lecture
* Started CS50 pset 8 (read up to "Specifications")

**Thoughts**:
I guess it's time for me to commit to something RE: databases. I was going to try SQL... but I think that we might be using a database for the Build-to-Learn project, and that will most likely be Mongo.db. So we'll have to see. Otherwise, using Express is a lot easier than I anticipated (although, in fairness, I've only ever tried to use it on my own computer - I haven't had to mess with ports or anything yet).

## Friday, 21 April

**Today's Progress**
* Finished & published blog post on random quote machine
* Completed timestamp microservice project (project 3 of FCC Speedrun Challenge)
* Wrote & published blog post on timestamp microservice project
* Read YDKJS ES6 Chapter 8

**Thoughts**:
I finished the *You Don't Know JS* books! They turned out to be a fantastic resource - even though, all the way through, I was wondering whether I was really understanding them well enough to get much out of them. Now, as I'm working on actual coding "projects" with the FCC Speedrun Challenge, I'm finding that I'm using (successfully, even!) tools that were hardly on my radar before I started the series.

Regarding the Speedrun itself... there's a part of me that wonders whether I might not learn more from taking the projects more slowly, making sure I have a solid understanding of the theory, that sort of thing? On the other hand, doing things this way means that later, when I go back and try to understand the foundations better, I'll at least go in knowing that this is something that *I CAN DO*. Because, you know, I'll already have done it.

## Thursday, 20 April

**Today's Progress**
* Completed random quote machine (project 2 of FCC Speedrun Challenge)
* Completed draft of write-up on random quote machine

**Thoughts**:

## Wednesday, 19 April

**Today's Progress**
* Completed tribute page (project 1 of FCC Speedrun Challenge)
* Completed and published(!) write-up of tribute page

**Thoughts**:
Really tired today... but Chingu Cohorts (and related project and challenges) are pretty motivating. It also got me to actually publish a blog post about my work... which is something kind of new for me.

## Tuesday, 18 April

**Today's Progress**
* Watched CS50 Week 10 Shorts
* Finished reading YDKJS ES7 Ch7
* Worked on Momentum clone project

**Thoughts**: The YDKJS reading is, I think, going a little bit over my head. But I've kind of decided I'm okay with that, and that this is probably just a series that I'll go back and reread a few months down the road.

I got a lot done today.

## Monday, 17 April

**Today's Progress**
* Watched CS50 Week 10 Lecture
* Started YDKJS ES6 Ch7 (up to [Proxies](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/es6%20%26%20beyond/ch7.md#proxies))

**Thoughts**:
The CS50 lecture was mostly (but not entirely) review. That said, the form validation information was both interesting and helpful.

## Sunday, 16 April

**Today's Progress**

## Saturday, 15 April

**Today's Progress**

## Friday, 14 April

**Today's Progress**
* Joined Rhinos Cohort (and added intro)
* Finished YDKJS ES6 Ch. 5, started Ch. 6 (did Arrays section)
* Finished write-up of mini-project (adding user stylesheets for github)

**Thoughts**: Chugging along. The end of the YDKJS books is in sight - which is a good thing. They've been a fantastic resource, but after working on them for almost 3 months, I'm ready to change things up a bit. I'm hoping that by the end of this next week, I'll be done with the YDKJS books & done with the Momentum clone. I'll still have CS50 to work on... and so many *new* things on the horizon!

## Thursday, 13 April

**Today's Progress**
* Finished working through YDKJS ES6 Chapter 4
* Read YDKJS Async & Performance Appendix B
* Started working through YDKJS ES6 Chapter 5 (up to sets)
* Revised write-up of "fix" to github's css (from last Friday)

**Thoughts**:
I didn't really understand a whole lot of Appendix B... but that's okay. I have a very, very rudimentary understanding of the concepts presented in that chapter, and I know where to go when I'm a little bit further along. After reviewing promises in YDKJS ES6 Chapter 4, I'm feeling a little bit more comfortable with that, and I'm marking the "Async" book complete.

## Wednesday, 12 April

**Today's Progress**
* Finished working through YDKJS ES6 Chapter 3
* Started YDKJS ES6 Chapter 4
* Met with team for momentum clone project

**Thoughts**:
A lot of the content of the YDKJS ES6 book is review -- which I badly needed. I'm starting to feel like things are dragging and I'm not making much progress. It might help to devote a day to just *finishing* some of the stuff I started, so that I can move forward.

## Tuesday, 11 April

**Today's Progress**
* Read through YDKJS ES6 Chapter 3 Modules section

**Thoughts**:
I'm unsure of how or where to actually play around with Javascript modules - they don't have browser support (yet), and I can't use them in Node.

**Link(s) to work**:

**Today's Progress**
* Pair programming with L (momentum clone)

**Thoughts**:
Getting close to finished with this one.

## Sunday, 9 April

**Today's Progress**
* Pair programming with L (momentum clone)
* Worked through YDKJS ES6 Chapter 3 Iterators section

**Thoughts**: I had fun today. Fixed a bug (it turns out that getting data from local storage is async - which I *should* have realized, had I actually thought about it...). I've still got a ways to go before I'll have real solid knowledge of the YDKJS material, but I'm definitely getting better.

**Today's Progress**
* Wrote JavaScript to "fix" GitHub's responsive layout so that I can read README files on a split screen
* Finished working through YDKJS ES6 Chapter 2

## Thursday, 6 April

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on YDKJS ES6 Chapter 2 (Destructuring, Object Literal Extensions)

**Thoughts**:
Slow going - I actually worked for quite a long time today... but I'm still feeling like it's not *enough*. Ah, well. Destructuring is kind of neat. I also like the "super" feature. I've been running into cases where I *wished* I could go up the prototype chain and call a "parent" function in the "child" function that overwrites it... and now I can. At least in certain circumstances if conditions are favorable.

* Began working on CS50 pset7 (implemented register, quote, buy)
* Worked on momentum project (fixed positioning of quote div)
* Read YDKJS ES6 chapters: Forward, Chapter 1
* Started YDKJS ES6 chapter 2: up to ["Destructuring"](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/es6%20%26%20beyond/ch2.md#destructuring)


**Thoughts**:
I'm feeling a little bit in over my head today. Actually - alternating between feeling like I'm learning a lot and feeling like I'll never learn enough. Ah, well. I guess I just keep chugging along

**Link(s) to work**:
Simple code examples to help me understand concepts from reading: [let and block scoping](https://github.com/AgathaLynn/web-development-learning-path/blob/master/You-Dont-Know-JS/practice/es6-ch2-let.js) & [spread operator](https://github.com/AgathaLynn/web-development-learning-path/blob/master/You-Dont-Know-JS/practice/es6-ch2-spread.js)

## Tuesday, 4 April

**Today's Progress**
* Read through YDKJS Async and Performance Appendix A, played with Asynquence library
* Watched CS50 Live S3E1 (SHAttered) - about how SHA-1 has been broken
* Met with T and L to discuss momentum progress

**Thoughts**:
I'm really shaky on the whole promises thing. My thought right now - because I'm starting to get annoyed at my lack of progress - is to go ahead and keep moving forward. I'm skipping Appendix B (there's no point in doing that until I understand promises better), and moving on. At some point soon I'll do a project that actually uses promises (not today, I can't start something new right now)... and I'll revist things then.

Still got a fair bit out of Appendix A, though. If nothing else, I learned how to install and use a module on my computer using npm.

## Saturday, 1 April

**Today's Progress**
* Finished YDKJS Async and Performance Chapter 4
* Read YDKJS Async and Performance Chapters 5 & 6

**Thoughts**:
This YDKJS book was trickier... and I still don't feel like I have a fantastic understanding of promises (either their use or their use *case*). I'm going to go ahead and move on for now... but I also thing that at some point I'll probably want to come back to chapter 3, at some point.

## Friday, 31 March

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on momentum project - looked into how to implement loading page

**Thoughts**:
I actually spent a fair bit of time working today, but I didn't really *accomplish* anything. I'm running into snags (that's good - means I'm learning) that I'm not sure how to resolve. I'd like to implement a loading page... but I'm having trouble figuring out how to signal to my code that everything is done "loading", so that the loading symbol can go away and the page can be revealed.

**Link(s) to work**:
Nothing new to speak of

## Thursday, 30 March

**Today's Progress**
* Worked through next section of YDKJS Async and Performance Chapter 4 (up to [Promise Concurrency in Generators](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/async%20%26%20performance/ch4.md#promise-concurrency-in-generators))

**Thoughts**:
Even when you don't think that you need to play with the example code in the reading... it's still not a bad idea. I *thought* I understood how one code snippet in the reading was working, and ended up spending over half an hour getting my "easy" sample to run. Yeah. I *think* I understand it now. But I'm glad I took the time to mess around with the code, before I tried to make it work on an actual project!

## Tuesday, 28 March

**Today's Progress**
* Began working on YDKJS Async & Performance Chapter 4 (up to [iterating generators asynchronously](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/async%20%26%20performance/ch4.md#iterating-generators-asynchronously))
* Mtg with momentum group

**Thoughts**:
Case sensitivity matters: I accidentally messed up one of my git "pushes" (fortunately just this log!) to github, because I accidentally typed a letter lowercase that was supposed to be uppercase. It looked right on my computer... but it wasn't right in github. I wonder if there's some sort of tool that would catch those errors and ask me if I'm *SURE*... I can't be the first person to accidentally type a lowercase letter instead of an uppercase one, and I could have ended up with a much bigger mess than I did.

Also... I actually used Node! I installed it a while back, and never did anything with it. And then today I used it to run programs. I made some simple programs (for getting the fibonacci sequence) to help me understand the reading for YDKJS... and I was able to run them from actual files on my own computer, without having to mess with the browser console. Neat!

## Sunday, 26 March

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on CSS for momentum project
* Pair programming on momentum project (with L)

**Thoughts**:
I like Javascript better than HTML and CSS. Which makes sense, I guess: Javascript is *programming*, and HTML and CSS kind of aren't. Also, technology is kind of frustrating at times.

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on refactoring todos (momentum project) & created pull request

**Thoughts**:
I kind of like refactoring.

## Friday, 24 March

**Today's Progress**
* Finished CS50 pset6
* Watched CS50 Week 9 lecture
* Pair programming (momentum project with T)
* Worked on refactoring todos (momentum project)

**Thoughts**:
I think I *might* be beginning to understand/appreciate the motivation behind MongoDB and other no-sql databases... *maybe*. Not because there's anything wrong with SQL, but more because the lecture talked about ways to kind of "hide" SQL so that you could interact with it like with an object, and it seems like Mongo might *kind of* be taking the "hiding" one step further. Or I might be completely wrong. It's just a sort of question/impression.

## Tuesday, 21 March

**Today's Progress**
* Watched CS50 Week 7 lecture
* Deployed yesterday's Writer's Block project using surge.sh
* Met with momentum group

**Thoughts**: Deploying the website was a lot easier than I thought it would be. And promises are a lot *harder* than I thought they would be. I'm actually not sure that it's promises that are the problem. It might be that I don't have a good use case for them. I had a couple of different ideas about how to use them... but they would require writing code to turn an xmlhhtprequest into a promise and/or writing code to turn an event listener into a promise. Which makes me wonder if maybe I'm not understanding when/how they're actually supposed to be used.

**Link(s) to work**:
Writer's Block website: http://writers-block.surge.sh

## Monday, 20 March

**Today's Progress**
* Finished CS50 pset 5 (using linked list)
* Watched CS50 Week 6 shorts: Internet Primer, IP, TCP, HTTP
* Created simple "writer's block" website to practice ajax requests (sans jQuery)
* Worked on momentum project todo list (pairing with T)

**Thoughts**: I'm not entirely happy with my solution to pset5 - a linked list is *NOT* the best data structure for the project - but I kind of needed to have that done, because I've been stuck on it for way too long. The spell checker is done, it works, and there are no memory leaks. It's just slow. And so we're moving on.

Today was a good day, programming-wise. Pairing on the momentum project went well - the todo list is functional, so that's cool. And I also made a simple (very, very simple) website to practice making API requests without using JQuery. I wanted to try using promises... but I realized I needed to take a step backward and do this first. So today was a lot of baby steps... but at least they were baby steps in the right direction!

To-dos: Tomorrow (or soon) I'd like to see about getting my practice project up online (maybe try out surge.sh?). And then keep chugging away on the other works-in-progress: CS50, momentum project, YDKJS.

## Sunday, 19 March

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on momentum project (pairing with L)
* Finished watching CS50 Week 6 lecture
* Worked on CS50 pset5

**Thoughts**: I implemented the load and unload functions for pset5... but I did so using a singly linked list, which is *NOT* going to do well speed-wise. I was having enough trouble with the problem set, though. Doing it this way made sense for now - I was at least able to get things working, basically. (Well... partially working, anyway.) And I can always go back and re-implement the thing using a different data structure. I probably *should* to back... but we'll see how things go.

I worked with L on the momentum project today, and chrome really wasn't liking our trying to make an api call to that one quote-generator. I think the problem has to do with some sort of security requirement implemented by chrome extensions (it worked fine in L's quote machine, and if I ran the "extension" from a file folder on my computer). But it frustrates me that I haven't been able to figure out what exactly the issue was, or how to resolve it. Maybe L will have better luck.

That Bender puzzle is a doozy... and the chingu group project is teaching me a lot... even though I haven't started actually coding yet and find the whole thing pretty overwhelming.

## Monday, 27 February

**Today's Progress**
* Installed Nodejs on computer and updated npm
* Did sections 1-15 of the "Getting Started" section of the npm Documentation
* Worked on bookstore website
* Met with BUILD-to-LEARN team in Chingu cohort

**Thoughts**: Installing npm was tricky, actually, but I think I have it working for now. As long as I don't have to do any updates or anything. So now I have another tool that I can play with.

**Link(s) to work**:
Not quite yet...

## Sunday, 26 February

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on bookstore website
* Solved "The Gift" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**: The bookstore website is coming along - today I got the "News" page done. We're kind of to the point where what's left is a bunch of annoying little tasks. That, and I'm kind of realizing there are a few things that maybe won't work exactly the way I wanted them to. Which is really just part of the learning process, and the reason I'm doing so many of these projects to begin with, right?

**Link(s) to work**:
Still nothing. Soon...

## Saturday, 25 February

**Today's Progress**
* Reread chapters 1-2 of YDKJS: Async & Performance

## Friday, 24 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Solved "Skynet Revolution: Episode 1" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Solved "Conway Sequence" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Began CS50 pset5

**Thoughts**: This CS50 problem set is going to take a while, I think... I probably need to plan on spending a few good long blocks of time on it. Otherwise, didn't do a whole lot today. I had intended to do a pair programming session this evening, but that didn't pan out. Hopefully another time...


**Link(s) to work**:
Still none.


## Thursday, 23 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on bookstore website
* Solved "Don't Panic - Episode 1" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Solved "Telephone Numbers" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Watched CS50 Week 5 Shorts: Hash Tables, Tries

**Thoughts**: Tries are kind of weird, and kind of neat. Both of these CodinGame puzzles were ones that seemed tricky on the outset, but the difficulty was really just in getting a good understanding of the problem - the code was actually pretty simple for both. Relatively speaking.
The bookstore website is coming along, and I'm getting more comfortable with git as well (today I created, merged, and deleted branches).

**Link(s) to work**:
Still none - hopefully that will be changing this next week.

## Wednesday, 22 February 2017

**Today's Progress**

**Thoughts**: CSS is a time suck. You'd never have guessed that I spent as much time as I did working on the thing. Also... I still think that iframes are kind of cool.

**Link(s) to work**:
Not online... still.

## Tuesday, 21 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Finished Shay Howe's "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series
* Began working on personal project (fake website for local bookstore)

**Thoughts**:
The "fake website" project is fun, and a great way to practice the HTML and CSS stuff that I just finished reading. It's a fake website, but I (being the incredibly uncreative person that I am) have *real* names and contact info in it... so it's not going onto github. Oh, well.

**Link(s) to work**:
Not online, unfortunately. I was actually kind of looking forward to having something to link to...

* Solved "Shadows of the Knight" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Completed lessons 10-11 of Shay Howe's "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series

**Thoughts**:
I think this is the 3rd (or 4th?) time that I've tried to do a binary search algorithm... and it's getting to the point where it's coming pretty naturally. That's a good thing.

* Watched CS50 Week 5 Shorts: Singly-Linked Lists, Doubly-Linked Lists

**Thoughts**:
Today's "Aha" moment (silly though it may be) was learning what iframes *are* and having at least a rudimentary understanding of how they work. Who knew that embedding a map into a website was so easy?!

I also have an idea for an "okay, now you try it" to do once I've finished reading through Howe's articles - a mock website for a local bookstore. Should be fun...

* Solved "Mayan Calculation" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Completed lessons 4-6 of Shay Howe's "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series

**Thoughts**:
The "Mayan Calculation" puzzles was already mostly solved on Wednesday. What I did today was basically just bug fixes and cleaning up the code a bit. The "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series is really helpful, and I'm pretty sure it's one I'll be referring back to. I can't wait to finish the tutorial and try a few simple projects, just so I can cement some of this stuff in my brain.

Also, the Chingu Cohorts start today, so that's exciting.

## Thursday, 16 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Finished watching CS50 Week 5 Lecture
* Completed lessons 1-3 of Shay Howe's "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series
* Reviewed and submitted homework for CS50 Week 2

**Thoughts**:
The information in the HTML & CSS articles is largely review, but it's *good* review. It's helpful to see examples of how a multi-page website is structured - different directories for "assets" (stylesheets, images), different files for different pages, etc. And how parts of the html and css are re-used across different pages on the same website.

**Link(s) to work**:

None today.

## Saturday, 11 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Solved "Whodunit" from the CS50 Week 4 homework assignments
* Watched CS50 Week 4 Shorts: Hexadecimal, Call Stack

**Thoughts**:
I also actually submitted pset0 for the CS50 course (they have the 2017 submission system set up now) - that isn't really a *coding* problem, though. More of an anxiety problem, I guess. I think I made the "Whodunit" problem a lot harder than it needed to be, but it was really interesting to actually get a peek at the details of *how* a computer actually stores images (specifically) and different types of files (more generally).

**Link(s) to work**:
Still none.

**Today's Progress**:
* Finished watching lecture from CS50 Week 4
* Worked thorugh You-Dont-Know-JS Book 5, Chapter 2
* Solved "War" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**:
I feel like a have, at best, a tenuous grasp of promises (the topic of the YDKJS reading). It might not be a bad idea to take a day or two and try to put together a (simple) project that uses them - possibly going back and doing a bare-bones (it doesn't have to be pretty) implementation of one of the FCC front-end projects (or some other project) that gets data from an API, just to see if I can make the material "click" a little bit better.

## Thursday, 9 February 2017

**Today's Progress**:
* Worked through You-Dont-Know-JS Book 5, Chapter 1
* Solved "Scrabble" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Began watching lecture from CS50 Week 4 (first 55 minutes)

**Thoughts**:
The CodinGame puzzle took a lot longer than it should have, but I got a bit of practice working with objects, and spent a *long* time trying to find a bug in my solution: turns out that if you pass a string into match (e.g. `str.match('a')`), it converts the string `a` to a regular expression and only looks for the *first* match. If you want to find *all* the 'a's, you need to use the RegExp constructor with the 'g' flag. Silly syntax problem... but I guess I'll remember that one better going forward.   

The part of the CS50 lecture that I watched had mainly to do with pointers... and explained some of (maybe all?) the asterisks I was getting so confused about during the last couple of homework assignments.

None today.

## Wednesday, 8 February 2017

**Today's Progress**:
* Worked through You-Dont-Know-JS Book 5, Chapter 1.
* Completed "Game of Fifteen" homework assignment from CS50 Week 3
* Solved "The Last Crusade" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**:
The CS50 assignment was fairly straightforward to implement - Manipulating *strings* in C still feels strange to me, but this assignment didn't involve too much of that. The YDKJS reading explains chunking and concurrency in a way that I *think* I can finally understand, and that kind of makes me want to go back and take another look at some of the FCC frontend projects that use APIs to get data.  

**Link(s) to work**:
The idea for (and format of) this log is taken from the [100 Days Of Code](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) challenge. Other than that, nothing today.
