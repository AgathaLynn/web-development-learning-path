# CS50 - work

## Week 0

Homework for Week 0 was to make a project using *Scratch*. I made a game - ["Harry the Herding Hippo"](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/141272514/). For me, the "aha" moment - the part that really made things click - was figuring out that you can use "broadcasts" to communicate between sprites. Is this similar to an event listener in JavaScript?
