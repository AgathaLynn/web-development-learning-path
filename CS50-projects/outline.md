# CS50 - work

## Week 0

Homework for Week 0 was to make a project using *Scratch*. I made a game - ["Harry the Herding Hippo"](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/141272514/). This was frustrating at first, but got *a lot* easier once I figured out that you can use "broadcasts" to communicate between sprites. My code (puzzle-blocks?) are a bit sloppier than I would like, but I'm going to go ahead and move forward anyway.
