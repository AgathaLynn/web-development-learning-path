## The Goal

... is basically to learn programming, emphasis on web development (yeah: I'll narrow it down further once I have a little bit more knowledge under my belt). I'm starting out following P1xt's [Guide: Get Job ready with 1 FCC cert, 3 projects, 2 courses, and 10 books](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/computer-guide-get-job-ready-with-1-fcc-cert-3-projects-2-courses-and-10-books/64027)... but I'm also planning to pull in projects/steps from P1xt's other two guides [here](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/computer-guide-computer-science-and-web-development-comprehensive-path/64470) and [here](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/computer-guide-web-development-with-computer-science-foundations-comprehensive-path/64516), and may end up switching over to one or the other entirely, depending on how things go.

## This Repository

... is both an outline of the path I'm following (checklist to follow - although the checklist itself is subject to change), and a place to record my progress.

## My Progress

Note: Sections are roughly equivalent to the tiers P1xt's outlines. Courses/Books/Projects that are part of the "Get Job-Ready" path are in bold. Courses/Books/Projects that are ONLY part of the "Computer Science and Web Development" path are italicized and marked with an asterisk. Courses/Books/Projects that are ONLY part of the "Web Development with Computer Science Foundations" path are italicized and marked with a tilde.
