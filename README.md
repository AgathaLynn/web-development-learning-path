## The Goal

... is basically to learn programming, emphasis on web development (yeah: I'll narrow it down further once I have a little bit more knowledge under my belt). I'm starting out following P1xt's [Guide: Get Job ready with 1 FCC cert, 3 projects, 2 courses, and 10 books](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready.md)... but I'm also planning to pull in projects/steps from P1xt's [more comprehensive guides](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides), and may end up switching over to one of those entirely, depending on how things go.

## This Repository

... is both an outline of the path I'm following (checklist to follow - although the checklist itself is subject to change), and a place to record my progress.

## My Progress

Note: Sections are roughly equivalent to the tiers P1xt's outlines. Courses/Books/Projects that are part of the "Get Job-Ready" path are in bold. Courses/Books/Projects that are ONLY part of the "Computer Science and Web Development" path are italicized and marked with an asterisk. Courses/Books/Projects that are ONLY part of the "Web Development with Computer Science Foundations" path are italicized and marked with a tilde.
