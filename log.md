# Progress Log

## Wednesday, 8 February 2017

**Today's Progress**:
* Worked through You-Dont-Know-JS Book 5, Chapter 1.
* Completed "Game of Fifteen" homework assignment from CS50 Week 3
* Solved "The Last Crusade" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**:
The CS50 assignment was fairly straightforward to implement - Manipulating *strings* in C still feels strange to me, but this assignment didn't involve too much of that. The YDKJS reading explains chunking and concurrency in a way that I *think* I can finally understand, and that kind of makes me want to go back and take another look at some of the FCC frontend projects that use APIs to get data.  

**Link(s) to work**:
The idea for (and format of) this log is taken from the [100 Days Of Code](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) challenge. Other than that, nothing today.
