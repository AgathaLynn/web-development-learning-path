## Wednesday, 8 March

**Today's Progress**
* Met with Chingu momentum team

**Thoughts**:
I'm a bit confused about how to separate the parts of a website so that different people can work on them independently. I suspect this project will be a case study in how NOT to do things... but it will be a great learning experience.

**Thoughts**:
The HTML stuff is getting easier, so there's that.

## Friday, 3 March

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on "Bender 1" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**:
I'm starting to get frustrated with this... I think I might put it away for a while and come back later

**Link(s) to work**:
None

## Thursday, 2 March

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on "Bender 1" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Met with Chingu group

**Thoughts**:
That Bender puzzle is a doozy... and the chingu group project is teaching me a lot... even though I haven't started actually coding yet and find the whole thing pretty overwhelming.

**Link(s) to work**:
Not yet... but soon, very very soon.

## Wednesday, 1 March

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on "Bender 1" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**:
I worked for a while today, but not as much as I would have liked. Hopefully I'll be able to do more tomorrow.

**Link(s) to work**:
Nada.

## Tuesday, 28 February

**Today's Progress**
* Did a little bit of reading on graphs... but not much

**Thoughts**:
Didn't really do anything today

**Link(s) to work**:
None

## Monday, 27 February

**Today's Progress**
* Installed Nodejs on computer and updated npm
* Did sections 1-15 of the "Getting Started" section of the npm Documentation
* Worked on bookstore website
* Met with BUILD-to-LEARN team in Chingu cohort

**Thoughts**: Installing npm was tricky, actually, but I think I have it working for now. As long as I don't have to do any updates or anything. So now I have another tool that I can play with.

**Link(s) to work**:
Not quite yet...

## Sunday, 26 February

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on bookstore website
* Solved "The Gift" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**: The bookstore website is coming along - today I got the "News" page done. We're kind of to the point where what's left is a bunch of annoying little tasks. That, and I'm kind of realizing there are a few things that maybe won't work exactly the way I wanted them to. Which is really just part of the learning process, and the reason I'm doing so many of these projects to begin with, right?

**Link(s) to work**:
Still nothing. Soon...

## Saturday, 25 February

**Today's Progress**
* Reread chapters 1-2 of YDKJS: Async & Performance

**Thoughts**: Wasn't able to code today... but the good news is that the YDKJS chapters made a lot more sense the second time I read through them.

**Link(s) to work**:
No work => no links.

## Friday, 24 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Solved "Skynet Revolution: Episode 1" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Solved "Conway Sequence" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Began CS50 pset5

**Thoughts**: This CS50 problem set is going to take a while, I think... I probably need to plan on spending a few good long blocks of time on it. Otherwise, didn't do a whole lot today. I had intended to do a pair programming session this evening, but that didn't pan out. Hopefully another time...


**Link(s) to work**:
Still none.


## Thursday, 23 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on bookstore website
* Solved "Don't Panic - Episode 1" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Solved "Telephone Numbers" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Watched CS50 Week 5 Shorts: Hash Tables, Tries

**Thoughts**: Tries are kind of weird, and kind of neat. Both of these CodinGame puzzles were ones that seemed tricky on the outset, but the difficulty was really just in getting a good understanding of the problem - the code was actually pretty simple for both. Relatively speaking.
The bookstore website is coming along, and I'm getting more comfortable with git as well (today I created, merged, and deleted branches).

**Link(s) to work**:
Still none - hopefully that will be changing this next week.

## Wednesday, 22 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Worked on bookstore website

**Thoughts**: CSS is a time suck. You'd never have guessed that I spent as much time as I did working on the thing. Also... I still think that iframes are kind of cool.

**Link(s) to work**:
Not online... still.

## Tuesday, 21 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Finished Shay Howe's "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series
* Began working on personal project (fake website for local bookstore)

**Thoughts**:
The "fake website" project is fun, and a great way to practice the HTML and CSS stuff that I just finished reading. It's a fake website, but I (being the incredibly uncreative person that I am) have *real* names and contact info in it... so it's not going onto github. Oh, well.

**Link(s) to work**:
Not online, unfortunately. I was actually kind of looking forward to having something to link to...


## Monday, 20 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Watched CS50 Week 5 Shorts: Stacks, Queues
* Solved "Shadows of the Knight" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Completed lessons 10-11 of Shay Howe's "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series

**Thoughts**:
I think this is the 3rd (or 4th?) time that I've tried to do a binary search algorithm... and it's getting to the point where it's coming pretty naturally. That's a good thing.

**Link(s) to work**:
Still none

## Sunday, 19 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Completed lesson 9 of Shay Howe's "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series
* Watched CS50 Week 5 Shorts: Singly-Linked Lists, Doubly-Linked Lists

**Thoughts**:
Today's "Aha" moment (silly though it may be) was learning what iframes *are* and having at least a rudimentary understanding of how they work. Who knew that embedding a map into a website was so easy?!

I also have an idea for an "okay, now you try it" to do once I've finished reading through Howe's articles - a mock website for a local bookstore. Should be fun...

**Link(s) to work**:
None today

## Saturday, 18 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Completed lessons 7-8 of Shay Howe's "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series

**Thoughts**:
Didn't do too much today...

**Link(s) to work**:
None

## Friday, 17 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Solved "Mayan Calculation" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Completed lessons 4-6 of Shay Howe's "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series

**Thoughts**:
The "Mayan Calculation" puzzles was already mostly solved on Wednesday. What I did today was basically just bug fixes and cleaning up the code a bit. The "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series is really helpful, and I'm pretty sure it's one I'll be referring back to. I can't wait to finish the tutorial and try a few simple projects, just so I can cement some of this stuff in my brain.

Also, the Chingu Cohorts start today, so that's exciting.

**Link(s) to work**:
None today... except for the sample project copied from "Learn to Code HTML & CSS." Which isn't mine.


## Thursday, 16 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Finished watching CS50 Week 5 Lecture
* Completed lessons 1-3 of Shay Howe's "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series
* Reviewed and submitted homework for CS50 Week 2

**Thoughts**:
The information in the HTML & CSS articles is largely review, but it's *good* review. It's helpful to see examples of how a multi-page website is structured - different directories for "assets" (stylesheets, images), different files for different pages, etc. And how parts of the html and css are re-used across different pages on the same website.

**Link(s) to work**:
Folder for "Learn to Code..." created in this directory. Not a link, though.


## Wednesday, 15 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Watched first 57 minutes of CS50 Week 5 Lecture
* Began working on "Mayan Calculation" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**:
I am *so* tired today...

**Link(s) to work**:
None.

## Tuesday, 14 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Mostly solved "Recover" from the CS50 Week 4 homework assignments

**Thoughts**
* Little bugs can take forever to figure out. Going away and coming back later can help.

**Link(s) to work**:
None today.

## Monday, 13 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Watched CS50 Week 4 Shorts: Structures
* Solved "Resize" (Less Comfortable Version) from the CS50 Week 4 homework assignments

**Thoughts**:
I've been trying to do the more difficult versions of the CS50 homework problems... but even the easier version of this one took me well over two hours. Maybe I'll go back and do the other one later... or maybe not. We'll see.

**Link(s) to work**:
None today.


## Sunday, 12 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Reviewed and submitted homework for CS50 Week 1
* Watched CS50 Week 4 Shorts: Pointers, Dynamic Memory Allocation
* Solved "Stock Exchange Losses" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**: Didn't do a whole lot today. Pointers and dynamic memory allocation don't seem *hard*, per se, just a lot of syntax and steps to keep track of.

**Link(s) to work**:
None today.

## Saturday, 11 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Solved "Whodunit" from the CS50 Week 4 homework assignments
* Watched CS50 Week 4 Shorts: Hexadecimal, Call Stack

**Thoughts**:
I also actually submitted pset0 for the CS50 course (they have the 2017 submission system set up now) - that isn't really a *coding* problem, though. More of an anxiety problem, I guess. I think I made the "Whodunit" problem a lot harder than it needed to be, but it was really interesting to actually get a peek at the details of *how* a computer actually stores images (specifically) and different types of files (more generally).

**Link(s) to work**:
Still none.

## Friday, 10 February 2017

**Today's Progress**:
* Finished watching lecture from CS50 Week 4
* Worked thorugh You-Dont-Know-JS Book 5, Chapter 2
* Solved "War" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**:
I feel like a have, at best, a tenuous grasp of promises (the topic of the YDKJS reading). It might not be a bad idea to take a day or two and try to put together a (simple) project that uses them - possibly going back and doing a bare-bones (it doesn't have to be pretty) implementation of one of the FCC front-end projects (or some other project) that gets data from an API, just to see if I can make the material "click" a little bit better.

**Link(s) to work**:
None today.

## Thursday, 9 February 2017

**Today's Progress**:
* Worked through You-Dont-Know-JS Book 5, Chapter 1
* Solved "Scrabble" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Began watching lecture from CS50 Week 4 (first 55 minutes)

**Thoughts**:
The CodinGame puzzle took a lot longer than it should have, but I got a bit of practice working with objects, and spent a *long* time trying to find a bug in my solution: turns out that if you pass a string into match (e.g. `str.match('a')`), it converts the string `a` to a regular expression and only looks for the *first* match. If you want to find *all* the 'a's, you need to use the RegExp constructor with the 'g' flag. Silly syntax problem... but I guess I'll remember that one better going forward.   

The part of the CS50 lecture that I watched had mainly to do with pointers... and explained some of (maybe all?) the asterisks I was getting so confused about during the last couple of homework assignments.

**Link(s) to work**:
None today.

## Wednesday, 8 February 2017

**Today's Progress**:
* Worked through You-Dont-Know-JS Book 5, Chapter 1.
* Completed "Game of Fifteen" homework assignment from CS50 Week 3
* Solved "The Last Crusade" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**:
The CS50 assignment was fairly straightforward to implement - Manipulating *strings* in C still feels strange to me, but this assignment didn't involve too much of that. The YDKJS reading explains chunking and concurrency in a way that I *think* I can finally understand, and that kind of makes me want to go back and take another look at some of the FCC frontend projects that use APIs to get data.  

**Link(s) to work**:
The idea for (and format of) this log is taken from the [100 Days Of Code](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) challenge. Other than that, nothing today.
