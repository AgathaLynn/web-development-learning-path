# Progress Log

## Friday, 17 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Solved "Mayan Calculation" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Completed lessons 4-6 of Shay Howe's "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series

**Thoughts**:
The "Mayan Calculation" puzzles was already mostly solved on Wednesday. What I did today was basically just bug fixes and cleaning up the code a bit. The "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series is really helpful, and I'm pretty sure it's one I'll be referring back to. I can't wait to finish the tutorial and try a few simple projects, just so I can cement some of this stuff in my brain.

Also, the Chingu Cohorts start today, so that's exciting.

**Link(s) to work"**:
None today... except for the sample project copied from "Learn to Code HTML & CSS." Which isn't mine.

**Today's Progress**
* Finished watching CS50 Week 5 Lecture
* Completed lessons 1-3 of Shay Howe's "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" series
* Reviewed and submitted homework for CS50 Week 2

**Thoughts**:
The information in the HTML & CSS articles is largely review, but it's *good* review. It's helpful to see examples of how a multi-page website is structured - different directories for "assets" (stylesheets, images), different files for different pages, etc. And how parts of the html and css are re-used across different pages on the same website.

**Link(s) to work**:
Folder for "Learn to Code..." created in this directory. Not a link, though.


## Wednesday, 15 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Watched first 57 minutes of CS50 Week 5 Lecture
* Began working on "Mayan Calculation" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**:
I am *so* tired today...

**Link(s) to work**:
None.

## Tuesday, 14 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Mostly solved "Recover" from the CS50 Week 4 homework assignments

**Thoughts**
* Little bugs can take forever to figure out. Going away and coming back later can help.

**Link(s) to work**:
None today.

## Monday, 13 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Watched CS50 Week 4 Shorts: Structures
* Solved "Resize" (Less Comfortable Version) from the CS50 Week 4 homework assignments

**Thoughts**:
I've been trying to do the more difficult versions of the CS50 homework problems... but even the easier version of this one took me well over two hours. Maybe I'll go back and do the other one later... or maybe not. We'll see.

**Link(s) to work**:
None today.


## Sunday, 12 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Reviewed and submitted homework for CS50 Week 1
* Watched CS50 Week 4 Shorts: Pointers, Dynamic Memory Allocation
* Solved "Stock Exchange Losses" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**: Didn't do a whole lot today. Pointers and dynamic memory allocation don't seem *hard*, per se, just a lot of syntax and steps to keep track of.

**Link(s) to work**:
None today.

## Saturday, 11 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Solved "Whodunit" from the CS50 Week 4 homework assignments
* Watched CS50 Week 4 Shorts: Hexadecimal, Call Stack

**Thoughts**:
I also actually submitted pset0 for the CS50 course (they have the 2017 submission system set up now) - that isn't really a *coding* problem, though. More of an anxiety problem, I guess. I think I made the "Whodunit" problem a lot harder than it needed to be, but it was really interesting to actually get a peek at the details of *how* a computer actually stores images (specifically) and different types of files (more generally).

**Link(s) to work**:
Still none.

## Friday, 10 February 2017

**Today's Progress**:
* Finished watching lecture from CS50 Week 4
* Worked thorugh You-Dont-Know-JS Book 5, Chapter 2
* Solved "War" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**:
I feel like a have, at best, a tenuous grasp of promises (the topic of the YDKJS reading). It might not be a bad idea to take a day or two and try to put together a (simple) project that uses them - possibly going back and doing a bare-bones (it doesn't have to be pretty) implementation of one of the FCC front-end projects (or some other project) that gets data from an API, just to see if I can make the material "click" a little bit better.

**Link(s) to work**:
None today.

## Thursday, 9 February 2017

**Today's Progress**:
* Worked through You-Dont-Know-JS Book 5, Chapter 1
* Solved "Scrabble" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Began watching lecture from CS50 Week 4 (first 55 minutes)

**Thoughts**:
The CodinGame puzzle took a lot longer than it should have, but I got a bit of practice working with objects, and spent a *long* time trying to find a bug in my solution: turns out that if you pass a string into match (e.g. `str.match('a')`), it converts the string `a` to a regular expression and only looks for the *first* match. If you want to find *all* the 'a's, you need to use the RegExp constructor with the 'g' flag. Silly syntax problem... but I guess I'll remember that one better going forward.   

The part of the CS50 lecture that I watched had mainly to do with pointers... and explained some of (maybe all?) the asterisks I was getting so confused about during the last couple of homework assignments.

**Link(s) to work**:
None today.

## Wednesday, 8 February 2017

**Today's Progress**:
* Worked through You-Dont-Know-JS Book 5, Chapter 1.
* Completed "Game of Fifteen" homework assignment from CS50 Week 3
* Solved "The Last Crusade" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**:
The CS50 assignment was fairly straightforward to implement - Manipulating *strings* in C still feels strange to me, but this assignment didn't involve too much of that. The YDKJS reading explains chunking and concurrency in a way that I *think* I can finally understand, and that kind of makes me want to go back and take another look at some of the FCC frontend projects that use APIs to get data.  

**Link(s) to work**:
The idea for (and format of) this log is taken from the [100 Days Of Code](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) challenge. Other than that, nothing today.
