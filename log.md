# Progress Log

## Sunday, 12 February 2017

**Today's Progress**
* Reviewed and submitted homework for CS50 Week 1
* Watched CS50 Week 4 Shorts: Pointers, Dynamic Memory Allocation
* Solved "Stock Exchange Losses" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**: Didn't do a whole lot today. Pointers and dynamic memory allocation don't seem *hard*, per se, just a lot of syntax and steps to keep track of.

**Link(s) to work**:
None today.

**Today's Progress**
* Solved "Whodunit" from the CS50 Week 4 homework assignments
* Watched CS50 Week 4 Shorts: Hexadecimal, Call Stack

**Thoughts**:
I also actually submitted pset0 for the CS50 course (they have the 2017 submission system set up now) - that isn't really a *coding* problem, though. More of an anxiety problem, I guess. I think I made the "Whodunit" problem a lot harder than it needed to be, but it was really interesting to actually get a peek at the details of *how* a computer actually stores images (specifically) and different types of files (more generally).

**Link(s) to work**:
Still none.

## Friday, 10 February 2017

**Today's Progress**:
* Finished watching lecture from CS50 Week 4
* Worked thorugh You-Dont-Know-JS Book 5, Chapter 2
* Solved "War" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**:
I feel like a have, at best, a tenuous grasp of promises (the topic of the YDKJS reading). It might not be a bad idea to take a day or two and try to put together a (simple) project that uses them - possibly going back and doing a bare-bones (it doesn't have to be pretty) implementation of one of the FCC front-end projects (or some other project) that gets data from an API, just to see if I can make the material "click" a little bit better.

**Link(s) to work**:
None today.

## Thursday, 9 February 2017

**Today's Progress**:
* Worked through You-Dont-Know-JS Book 5, Chapter 1
* Solved "Scrabble" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium
* Began watching lecture from CS50 Week 4 (first 55 minutes)

**Thoughts**:
The CodinGame puzzle took a lot longer than it should have, but I got a bit of practice working with objects, and spent a *long* time trying to find a bug in my solution: turns out that if you pass a string into match (e.g. `str.match('a')`), it converts the string `a` to a regular expression and only looks for the *first* match. If you want to find *all* the 'a's, you need to use the RegExp constructor with the 'g' flag. Silly syntax problem... but I guess I'll remember that one better going forward.   

The part of the CS50 lecture that I watched had mainly to do with pointers... and explained some of (maybe all?) the asterisks I was getting so confused about during the last couple of homework assignments.

**Link(s) to work**:
None today.

## Wednesday, 8 February 2017

**Today's Progress**:
* Worked through You-Dont-Know-JS Book 5, Chapter 1.
* Completed "Game of Fifteen" homework assignment from CS50 Week 3
* Solved "The Last Crusade" from CodinGame Classic Puzzles - Medium

**Thoughts**:
The CS50 assignment was fairly straightforward to implement - Manipulating *strings* in C still feels strange to me, but this assignment didn't involve too much of that. The YDKJS reading explains chunking and concurrency in a way that I *think* I can finally understand, and that kind of makes me want to go back and take another look at some of the FCC frontend projects that use APIs to get data.  

**Link(s) to work**:
The idea for (and format of) this log is taken from the [100 Days Of Code](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) challenge. Other than that, nothing today.
